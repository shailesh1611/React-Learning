# In this Episode, we will learn how to create a react project production ready from stratch.
# We will install all the packages, files required for this.
# Some Useful Terms and Notes :-

# 1. npm => npm is a package manager for the javascript which has majorily all the packages related to javascript.

# 2. Packages => A package is a compressed file that includes all the necessary files required for the software application that provides any fuctionality.

# 3. Dependencies => A depency is a package on which our project or app is dependent. It means that package is required to run or install our software or app.

# 4. Package.json => Package.json holds important information about the project. It contains human-readable metadata about the project (like the project name and description) as well as functional metadata like the package version number and a list of dependencies required by the application.

# 5. Uses of package.json file => Your project's package.json is the central place to configure and describe how to interact with and run your application. It is used by the npm CLI (and yarn) to identify your project and understand how to handle the project's dependencies. It's the package.json file that enables npm to start your project, run scripts, install dependencies, publish to the NPM registry, and many other useful tasks. The npm CLI is also the best way to manage your package.json because it helps generate and update your package.json file throughout a project's life. Your project must include a package.json before any packages can be installed from NPM. This is probably the top reason why you need one in your project.


# Some Steps to do perform task :-
#    Step 1 - run npm init on cli.
#    Step 2 - Give all the necessary information like version, author etc.
